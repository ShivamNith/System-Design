# Command Pattern

## Overview
The Command Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that encapsulates a request as an object, allowing you to parameterize clients with different requests, queue operations, log requests, and support undo functionality. It decouples the object that invokes the operation from the object that performs it.

## Problem Statement
In traditional object-oriented programming, when you need to:
- Execute operations at different times
- Queue, log, or support undo operations
- Parameterize objects with actions
- Support macro recording and playback

Direct method calls create tight coupling between invoker and receiver, making it difficult to implement features like undo/redo, queuing, or logging.

## Solution
The Command pattern solves this by:
1. **Encapsulating Requests**: Each request becomes a command object
2. **Decoupling Invoker and Receiver**: Invoker doesn't know about receiver implementation
3. **Supporting Undo/Redo**: Commands can implement reverse operations
4. **Enabling Queuing**: Commands can be stored and executed later

## Structure

### Components
1. **Command Interface**: Defines the execution interface (usually `execute()` method)
2. **Concrete Command**: Implements the command interface and encapsulates receiver actions
3. **Receiver**: The object that performs the actual work
4. **Invoker**: Asks the command to carry out the request
5. **Client**: Creates concrete command objects and sets their receivers

## Implementation Details

### Key Characteristics
- **Encapsulation**: Each command encapsulates a complete request
- **Parameterization**: Objects can be configured with different commands
- **Queuing**: Commands can be stored and executed later
- **Logging**: Commands can be logged for auditing or replay
- **Undo/Redo**: Commands can implement reverse operations

### Command Types
1. **Simple Command**: Basic command with execute method
2. **Undoable Command**: Includes undo functionality
3. **Macro Command**: Composite command containing multiple commands
4. **Queued Command**: Command designed for delayed execution

### Benefits
1. **Decoupling**: Invoker and receiver are decoupled
2. **Flexibility**: Easy to add new commands without changing existing code
3. **Undo/Redo**: Natural support for reversible operations
4. **Logging/Auditing**: Commands can be logged and replayed
5. **Queuing**: Commands can be queued for batch processing
6. **Macro Recording**: Complex operations can be recorded and replayed

### Drawbacks
1. **Complexity**: Increases number of classes in the system
2. **Memory Overhead**: Each command is a separate object
3. **Performance**: May impact performance for simple operations
4. **State Management**: Undo operations may require state storage

## When to Use
- Need to parameterize objects with operations
- Want to queue, schedule, or log requests
- Need to support undo operations
- Want to structure system around high-level operations
- Need to support macro recording and playback

## Real-world Applications
1. **GUI Applications**: Menu items, buttons, and keyboard shortcuts
2. **Text Editors**: Undo/redo functionality
3. **Database Transactions**: Transaction management and rollback
4. **Network Protocols**: Request/response handling
5. **Game Development**: Action recording and replay
6. **Workflow Systems**: Step-by-step process execution

## Implementation Examples
1. **Text Editor with Undo/Redo**: Document editing commands with undo support
2. **Smart Home Automation**: Device control commands with scheduling
3. **Restaurant Order System**: Order processing with modification and cancellation

## Best Practices
1. Keep commands focused on single operations
2. Implement undo carefully with proper state management
3. Consider memory usage for command history
4. Use macro commands for complex operations
5. Implement command validation before execution
6. Design commands to be serializable if needed for persistence
