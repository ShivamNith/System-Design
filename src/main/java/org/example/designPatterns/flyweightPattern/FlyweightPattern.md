# Flyweight Pattern

## Overview
The Flyweight Pattern is a structural design pattern that minimizes memory usage by sharing common data among multiple objects. Instead of storing all data in each object, the flyweight pattern separates intrinsic (shared) data from extrinsic (context-specific) data.

## Problem Statement
When you need to create a large number of similar objects, storing all the data in each object can be memory-intensive. For example, in a text editor, each character object would store font, size, and color information, leading to massive memory consumption for large documents.

## Solution
The Flyweight pattern solves this by:
1. **Intrinsic State**: Shared data that can be stored in the flyweight
2. **Extrinsic State**: Context-specific data passed to flyweight methods
3. **Flyweight Factory**: Manages and reuses flyweight instances

## Structure

### Components
1. **Flyweight Interface**: Defines methods that accept extrinsic state
2. **Concrete Flyweight**: Implements the flyweight interface and stores intrinsic state
3. **Flyweight Factory**: Creates and manages flyweight instances
4. **Context**: Stores extrinsic state and references to flyweight objects

## Implementation Details

### Key Characteristics
- **Immutable Flyweights**: Flyweight objects should be immutable
- **Factory Management**: Use a factory to ensure flyweight reuse
- **State Separation**: Clear distinction between intrinsic and extrinsic state
- **Memory Efficiency**: Significant memory savings when many similar objects exist

### Benefits
1. **Reduced Memory Usage**: Shares common data among objects
2. **Performance**: Fewer object allocations and garbage collection
3. **Scalability**: Handles large numbers of objects efficiently
4. **Flexibility**: Maintains object-oriented design principles

### Drawbacks
1. **Complexity**: Added complexity in state management
2. **CPU vs Memory Trade-off**: May increase CPU usage due to state calculations
3. **Context Management**: Requires careful management of extrinsic state

## When to Use
- Creating large numbers of similar objects
- Object storage cost is high
- Most object state can be made extrinsic
- Groups of objects can be replaced by few shared objects

## Real-world Applications
1. **Text Editors**: Character formatting and rendering
2. **Game Development**: Particle systems, terrain tiles
3. **Web Browsers**: DOM element rendering
4. **Graphics Applications**: Shape and icon management

## Implementation Examples
1. **Text Editor Character System**: Managing font and character formatting
2. **Game Particle System**: Handling large numbers of particles efficiently
3. **Tree Forest Simulation**: Rendering large numbers of similar trees

## Best Practices
1. Identify intrinsic vs extrinsic state clearly
2. Make flyweight objects immutable
3. Use factory pattern for flyweight management
4. Consider thread safety in multi-threaded environments
5. Document state responsibilities clearly
