- Store intrinsic state: tag type, default styles, behavior
- Store extrinsic state: position, content, custom styles, ID
- Implement a factory to manage element type flyweights
- Create a DOM tree that can render multiple elements efficiently

### Classes to implement:
- `HTMLElementFlyweight` interface
- `ElementType` concrete flyweight
- `ElementTypeFactory` 
- `DOMElement` context class
- `WebPage` client class
