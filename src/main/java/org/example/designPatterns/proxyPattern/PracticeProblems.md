# Proxy Pattern - Practice Problems

## Problem 1: Remote Service Proxy
**Difficulty: Medium**

Design a proxy for accessing remote web services with automatic retry and connection management.

### Requirements:
- Create a proxy for a remote API service
- Implement connection pooling and timeout handling

- Log all remote service calls and responses

### Classes to implement:
- `RemoteService` interface
- `RealRemoteService` implementation
- `RemoteServiceProxy` proxy with connection management
- `ConnectionPool` utility class
- `CircuitBreaker` utility class

## Problem 2: Logging Proxy
**Difficulty: Easy**

Create a logging proxy that wraps any object and logs all method calls.

### Requirements:

- Log method names, parameters, and return values
- Measure and log execution time for each method
- Support different log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR)
- Allow filtering of methods to log

### Classes to implement:
- `LoggingProxy` using Java dynamic proxy
- `LogConfiguration` for configuring logging behavior
- `MethodFilter` for selective logging
- Example target classes to demonstrate logging

**Difficulty: Hard**

Build a file system proxy that implements lazy loading and caching for file operations.

### Requirements:
- Create proxy for file system operations (read, write, list, etc.)
- Implement lazy loading for directory contents
- Cache file metadata and content for frequently accessed files
- Support different caching strategies (LRU, TTL-based)
- Handle file change notifications and cache invalidation
- Provide compression/decompression for cached content

### Classes to implement:
- `FileSystem` interface
- `RealFileSystem` implementation
- `LazyFileSystemProxy` with caching
- `CacheStrategy` interface with implementations
- `FileChangeWatcher` for invalidation

**Difficulty: Medium**

Design a comprehensive security proxy system with role-based access control.

### Requirements:
- Implement role-based permissions (CREATE, READ, UPDATE, DELETE)
- Support hierarchical roles (admin > manager > user > guest)
- Add time-based access restrictions (business hours only)
- Implement IP address whitelisting/blacklisting
- Provide audit logging for all access attempts
- Support temporary permission elevation

### Classes to implement:
- `SecuredResource` interface
